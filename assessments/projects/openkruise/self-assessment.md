# OpenKruise Self-assessment

The Self-assessment is the initial document for projects to begin thinking
about the security of the project, determining gaps in their security, and
preparing any security documentation for their users. This document is ideal
for projects currently in the CNCF **sandbox** as well as projects that are
looking to receive a joint assessment and currently in CNCF **incubation**.

## Overview

OpenKruise is an open-source project that focuses on extending the capabilities
of Kubernetes. It provides a set of custom controllers and tools to enhance and
simplify application lifecycle management on Kubernetes clusters.

OpenKruise aims to address various aspects of application management, including
rolling updates, canary releases, blue-green deployments, and more. It is
designed to help users automate and manage the deployment and scaling of
applications on Kubernetes with additional features beyond the standard
Kubernetes functionality

### Background

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for declaratively configuring and
automating containerized applications, which are referred to as workloads and
services. While Kubernetes provides some has features for deployment and
management of applications, it's not considered enough by many who aim to do
this in large-scale production clusters.

> OpenKruise is an extended component suite for Kubernetes, which mainly
> focuses on automated management of large-scale applications, such
> as *deployment, upgrade, ops and availability protection*.

A Kubernetes cluster is split into two main components, Control Plane
Components which make global decisions about the cluster and Node Components
which manage Pods and provide the runtime environment. OpenKruise is a set of
additional components that extend the Kubernetes API to support advanced use
cases. In-place Update is one of the key features for updating of images on
Pods. Other key features are Advanced Workloads, Bypass Application Management,
High-availability protection, and High-level operation features.

Most features developed by OpenKruise are based on CRD extensions. This is the
recommended way of extending functionality and doesn't require additional
dependencies. With Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) you can create new
resource types without adding a new API Server.

### Actors

- `kruise-operator`
  - `kubectl-kruise`
  - Golang and Java clients
- `kruise-manager`
  - `kruise-controller`
  - `kruise-webhook`
- `kruise-daemon`
- `kube-apiserver`
- `kubelet`
- Pods and containers

#### `kruise-operator`

The operator is the person administrating or operating the system. This person
has authorization to access the OpenKruise system and perform actions. The
operator interacts with OpenKruise using the CLI or client SDK.

#### `krusie-manager`

This is a control plane component that runs controllers and webhooks.
Logically, each controller is a separate process but to reduce complexity they
are compiled into the same binary running on the API server. It consists of a
`kruise-controller` and `kruise-webhook`.

- `kruise-controller` - Responsible for checking the that the configuration is
  in the desiredstate based on the user-configuration. It checks the resources
  across all of the nodes and ensures they are up-to-date.

- `kruise-webhook` - Used for admission control. It intercepts，validates and
  potentially mutates requests coming from the `kruise-operator`. The
  `kruise-webhook` is important since the `kube-apiserver` will fail the
  request if the calling to the `kruise-webhook` fails.

#### `kruise-daemon`

This runs on every node and manages things like image pre-download and
container restarting. It interacts with the `kruise-manager` indirectly by
calling the API Server which calls through.

#### `kube-apiserver`

The Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the api objects.
This include pods, services, replicationcontrollers, and other things. It
provides the frontend to the clusters shared state.

#### `kubelet`

The `kubelet` runs on each node. It's the primary "node-agent" that can register
the node with the apiserver so that pods on that node can be managed.

### Actions

These are the steps that a project performs in order to provide some service
or functionality. These steps are performed by different actors in the system.
Note, that an action need not be overly descriptive at the function call level.
It is sufficient to focus on the security checks performed, use of sensitive
data, and interactions between actors to perform an action.

For example, the access server receives the client request, checks the format,
validates that the request corresponds to a file the client is authorized to
access, and then returns a token to the client. The client then transmits that
token to the file server, which, after confirming its validity, returns the file.

#### Operator based action

One of the possible ways of interacting with the system are if a
`kruise-operator` takes a manual action to administer some part of the system
by using the CLI or a client SDK.

##### Actors

- `kruise-operator` - The person administrating or operating the system
- `kubectl-kruise` - Allows user to interact with OpenKruise resources
- `kruise-manager` - Processes user requests and oversees operations
- `kruise-daemon` - Performs tasks at node level and monitors status of nodes

##### Workflow

1.  `kruise-operator` executes `kubctl-kruise` to initiate manual action
    1.  Examples of manual action are scale and rollout
2.  `kubctl-kruise` calls the `kruise-manager` which is part of the Control Plane
3.  `kruise-daemon` calls the `kruise-manager` through the `kube-apiserver`
4.  `kruise-daemon` executes an operation on the node
    1.  Example include pre-image download and container restarting

#### InPlace Update

In-place update is a feature of OpenKruise that allows you to update the image
of a container in a Pod without having to recreate the Pod. This can save time
and resources, as it avoids the need to schedule a new Pod, allocate an IP
address, and mount volumes. In-place update is also faster than recreating a
Pod, as it can reuse the image layers that are already pulled on the node.

##### Actors

- `kruise-manager` - Processes user requests and oversees operations
- `kruise-daemon` - Performs tasks at node level and monitors status of nodes
- `kublet` - Runs on each node and can register the node with the apiserver

##### Workflow

1.  `kruise-manager` starts to update a pod
2.  `kruise-manager` updates the changed fields in the pod
3.  `kubelet` stops the old container
4.  `kubelet` pulls the image, creates, and starts new container
5.  `kruise-manager` updates local conditions for `InPlaceUpdate`
6.  `kubelet` update Pod Status to be ready

#### Declarative configuration

Kubernetes handles Custom Resource Definitions by default. For each component
we want to add from OpenKruise a CRD in the form of a yaml file is specified
with a particular kind and different settings pertaining to that service. Since
handling these definition are part of Kubernetes, they should not be considered
as an action for OpenKruise.

### Goals

#### General

- OpenKruise plays a complementary role to Kubernetes
- Most features work on Kubernetes clusters without any other dependencies
- Provide **Advanced Workloads** which extend basic, default Workloads
- **Decoupled Application Management** to manage apps without modifying Workloads
  - Provide reliable In-Place update for updating existing Pod images
- **High-availability Protection** provides extended ways of protecting availability
- OpenKruise simplifies sidecar injection and enables sidecar In-Place update.
  OpenKruise also enhances the sidecar startup and termination control.
- Multi-domain Management: This can help you manage applications over nodes
  with multiple domains, such as different node pools, available zones,
  architectures (x86 & arm) or node types (kubelet and virtual kubelet)

#### Security

- OpenKruise components should be protected and robust against tampering
- Authenticating and authorizing access OpenKruise to control plane components
- Protect the OpenKruise control plane from being compromised

### Non-goals

#### General

- OpenKruise is **not** a PaaS and it will **not** provide any abilities of PaaS
- Providing ways of managing containers without Kubernetes
- Replacement for kubernetes: OpenKruise is not intended as a means to replace
  kubernetes, rather it is an extension to Kubernetes providing extra features
  on top.
- Standardization of deployment strategies: OpenKruise introduces several
  advanced deployment strategies, it does not aim to standardize these
  strategies across Kubernetes cluster. Users are free to manipulate the
  strategy based on their needs.

#### Security

- OpenKruise doesn't provide additional security for Kubernetes
- No guarantee of security when an attacker has compromised the system

## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment is created by the OpenKruise team to perform an internal
analysis of the project's security. It is not intended to provide a security
audit of OpenKruise, or function as an independent assessment or attestation
of OpenKruise's security health.

This document serves to provide OpenKruise users with an initial understanding
of OpenKruise's security, where to find existing security documentation,
OpenKruise plans for security, and general overview of OpenKruise security
practices, both for development of OpenKruise as well as security of
OpenKruise.

This document provides the CNCF TAG-Security with an initial understanding of
OpenKruise to assist in a joint-assessment, necessary for projects under
incubation. Taken together, this document and the joint-assessment serve as a
cornerstone for if and when OpenKruise seeks graduation and is preparing for a
security audit.

## Security functions and features

### Critical

- Security scanning with Snyk in the CI pipeline identifies vulnerabilities in
  container images so only verified images are displayed.
- Security scanning with CodeQL in the CI pipeline identifies variants of known
  security vulnerability in the codebase.
- Supporting only recent software versions that provide patches and updates
  mitigates general vulnerabilities.

### Security Relevant

- Regularly scanning the code in the main (master) and nightly builds, as well
  as in pull requests (PRs) for the Go programming language helps identify any
  potential vulnerabilities or issues before release.
- Scanning the container images that are published on the GitHub Container
  Registry ensures that the images, which are used to run OpenKruise in a
  Kubernetes environment, are secure.

### Threat Modeling with STRIDE

#### Spoofing:

- Threat-01-S: Impersonating an Administrator
- An attacker could impersonate an OpenKruise admin, maintainer, or somebody
  with elevated privilege in order to access data within the containers, code
  repositories, or contributions from other developers.

##### Recommended Mitigations

- Assign proper roles (per principle of least privilege) to the users using
  Role Based Authorization Control of Kubernetes.
- Use mutual TLS to confirm that both OpenKruise and the Kubernetes cluster
  authenticate each other's identities before connecting.

#### Tampering:

- Threat-03-T: Altering Critical Components
- OpenKruise components could be tampered with during build, installation, or
  runtime, potentially allowing an attacker to download malware into the host
  system, OpenKruise itself, or Kubernetes.

##### Recommended Mitigations

- Use checksums and/or digital signatures to monitor for unauthorized
  modifications.
- Only allow the downloading of OpenKruise components from the official website
  and/or Helm package manager

#### Repudiation:

- Threat-04-R: Denial of Administrator Actions
- OpenKruise admins of Kubernetes applications may deny or misrepresent actions
  they have performed, particularly if they include any changes made to
  configuration updates or scaling within the Kubernetes clusters managed by
  OpenKruise.

##### Recommended Mitigations

Enable the auditing logs of Kubernetes apiserver so any request to OpenKruise
is logged.

#### Information Disclosure:

- Threat-05-I: Vulnerability Exploitation Through User Reports
- OpenKruise relies on user-reporting of vulnerabilities through Gmail or
  GitHub. If a user discovers a bug and reports it, an attacker may find a way
  to view such reports and exploit the bug before it can be fixed.

##### Recommended Mitigations

- Report vulnerability via github security page or private email
- Encrypt all logs of vulnerability reports sent by users to OpenKruise and
  implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to the log
  storage.

#### Denial of Service:

- Threat-06-D: Resource Exhaustion in Controllers
- OpenKruise controllers, daemons, or the applications being managed may
  consume more resources than allocated and affect the availability of the
  Kubernetes cluster.

##### Recommended Mitigations

- Use rate limiting to lessen the number of requests a user can make to
  OpenKruise's components.
- Set the resource request and limit values of OpenKruise component so as to
  limit the resource usage of Openkruise under attackers

#### Elevation of Privilege:

- Threat-07-E: Unauthorized Access to Kubernetes Resources
- If an attacker compromises a part of OpenKruise, particularly one that has
  permissions to modify Kubernetes resources, they could potentially escalate
  their privileges within the Kubernetes cluster.

##### Recommended Mitigations

- Enable only required features of OpenKruise via feature gates, so give
  OpenKruise least privilege necessary in regards to Kubernetes.
- Grant access of kruise-manager to limited and trusted operators
- Grant access of the OpenKruise API, especially the one of cluster scope such
  as SidecarSet and ResourceDistribution to limited and trusted operators

## Project compliance

OpenKruise does not document meeting particular compliance standards

## Secure development practices

- [OpenKruise is tagged as "in progess"](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/2908)

    company specializing in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology.
    Alibaba had made its core systems fully cloud-native, and had managed more
    than 10w OpenKruise workload, and gained 80% improvement in deployment
    efficiency. Alibaba had utilized many workloads in OpenKruise, including
    CloneSet, Advance StatefulSet, SidecarSet, Advance DaemonSet etc. Their
    story had been presented in many [blog posts](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/openkruise-the-cloud-native-platform-for-the-comprehensive-process-of-alibabas-double-11_596966).
  - Ctrip: a Chinese multinational online travel company, is using OpenKruise
    advanced workload to build their cloud native PaaS platform. They rely on
    the inplace update feature of openkruise and manage more than 2.8w CloneSet
    and 200+ advance StatefulSet. Their story had been presented in a [KubeMeet
    sharing](https://developer.aliyun.com/ebook/7564/87513)
  - Oppo: a Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer, is using OpenKruise to
    manage large scale stateful applications. Oppo rely on the inplace-update
    feature of OpenKruise, and had even customized K8S so that OpenKruise can
    be extended to inplace update fields other than container images. They
    share their story in a [blog
    post](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hRvZz_bZfchmP0tkF6M2OA).
  - Ant Group: formerly known as Ant Financial, a world leading internet open
    platform, owns the world's largest online payment platform Alipay. Ant
    Group chose Kubernetes to orchestrate the tens-of-thousands-of-node
    clusters in its data centers. To manage these nodes, they chose OpenKruise
    advance daemonset to manage node agents, utilizing the enhanced rolling
    strategy such as rolling selector, partition rolling. They are consented to
    share necessary details privately with the TOC, if required.
  - LinkedIn: a leading business and employment-oriented online service in
    America， is using OpenKruise CloneSet to manage large scale workloads for
    the inplace-update and enhanced PVC support feature. In addition, they're
    evaluating the container launch priority feature to ensure their
    configuration update sequence in pod creation as well as container
    inplace-update scenarios.
